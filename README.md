# A Lightweight App for Live Video

Use our lightweight, camera app to get started running prediction on a live video stream using machine learning models.

In this example, we use the on-device, [Style Transfer API](https://docs.fritz.ai/develop/vision/style-transfer/android.html) in order to apply a style to each frame of a video; however, you can follow the directions for any of the [Vision APIs](https://docs.fritz.ai/develop/vision/index.html) or add your own [Custom Models](https://docs.fritz.ai/develop/custom-models/index.html).
